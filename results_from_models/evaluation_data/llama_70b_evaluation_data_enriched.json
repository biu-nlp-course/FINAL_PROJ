Shuli arrived earlier than David, so Shuli must be first or second in the order.\n2. John entered later than Rina, so John must be third or fourth in the order.\n3. Rina showed up later than David, so Rina must be third or fourth in the order.\n4. Combining these constraints, we can see that Shuli and David must be the first two, in either order.\n5.

    "A nice puzzle!\n\nAfter analyzing the constraints, I found two possible arrangements that satisfy all the conditions. Here are the solutions:\n\n[Answer: \n[['John', 'Moshe', 'Bob', 'David'], \n ['John', 'Moshe', 'David', 'Bob']]]\n\nLet me explain how I arrived at these solutions:\n\n1. From the first constraint, we know Bob stands rightward from Moshe, so Moshe must be to the left of Bob.\n2. From the second constraint, we know David is positioned on the right side of John, so John must be to the left of David.\n3. From the third constraint, we know John stands to the left of Bob, so John must be to the left of both Bob and Moshe (since Moshe is to the left of Bob).\n\nNow, let's combine these constraints:\n\n* John is to the left of both Bob and Moshe, so John must be the leftmost person.\n* Moshe is to the left of Bob, so Moshe must be second from the left.\n* Bob is to the right of Moshe, so Bob must be third from the left.\n* David is to the right of John, so David must be fourth from the left (i.e., on the rightmost side).\n\nThis leads to the first arrangement: ['John', 'Moshe', 'Bob', 'David'].\n\nHowever, we can also swap the positions of Bob and David, since the constraints don't specify their relative order. This leads to the second arrangement: ['John', 'Moshe', 'David', 'Bob'].\n\nThese two arrangements satisfy all the constraints, and there are no other possible arrangements that meet all the conditions.",

    "A nice puzzle!\n\nAfter analyzing the constraints, I've found all possible arrangements. Here are the legal arrangements:\n\n[Answer: \n[['John', 'Emily', 'Rina', 'Bob'], \n ['John', 'Emily', 'Bob', 'Rina'], \n ['John', 'Bob', 'Emily', 'Rina'], \n ['Bob', 'John', 'Emily', 'Rina']]]\n\nLet me explain how I arrived at these solutions:\n\n1. Emily is to the right of John, so John must be on the left of Emily.\n2. Rina is to the right of Emily, so Emily must be on the left of Rina.\n3. Rina is to the left of Bob, so Bob must be on the right of Rina.\n\nWith these constraints, we can start building the arrangements:\n\n* John-Emily-Rina-Bob: This arrangement satisfies all constraints.\n* John-Emily-Bob-Rina: This arrangement also satisfies all constraints, as Emily is still to the right of John, and Rina is still to the right of Emily and to the left of Bob.\n* John-Bob-Emily-Rina: This arrangement is possible, as John is still on the left of Emily, and Rina is still to the right of Emily and to the left of Bob.\n* Bob-John-Emily-Rina: This arrangement is the only one where Bob is on the left, but it still satisfies all constraints.\n\nNo other arrangements are possible without violating one of the constraints.",
